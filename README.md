##### Abstract:
A Software Development Life Cycle may be analyzed with Lean Manufacturing principles with Key Performance Indicators of lead-time and activity-ratio.  An Application Lifecycle Management repository change history log provides a time-stamped sequence of software component state changes at an established U.S. organization.  The project objective is to find the influencers of and inefficiencies within the development life cycle through study of the given transaction log.  An interactive visualization provides ad-hoc exploratory analysis of sequence wait time, a correlation test finds a surprising relationship between team maturity and activity-ratio, and a regression analysis supports the elusiveness of lead-time.  The case-study demonstrates to the organization how tools pgAdmin, Tableau, SAS, R, and GitHub can be used to analyze the dataset.
Keywords: SDLC, Lead Time, Activity Ratio, Tableau, R, SAS, PostgreSQL, GitHub.
